# Image-Segmentation-using-Unet
Hello, this python deep learning project consists of a U net trained model which is trained on neuclei images.
This U net architecture is actually a highly refered architecture for Image segmentation. Here I did semantic image segementation, highlighting the nuclei of the cells.
